paludis-autopatches
===================

My set of patches to apply beside ebuilds do.
To do so, I use my [autopatch](https://github.com/zaufi/paludis-hooks) 
hook to avoid writing ebuild just to test some trivial patch.
Default path to clone is `/var/paludis/autopatches`, but one can override
it in [autopatch config](https://github.com/zaufi/paludis-config/blob/master/hooks/configs/auto-patch.conf).
